September 2024 3 Mins Read Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin claims that he has never sold his ETH holdings since 2018, following rumours about transaction activities. However, reports hint that Buterin recently transferred $10 million worth of ETH to an exchange	ethereum
Ethereum’s (ETH) Vitalik Buterin has responded to widely speculated rumours that suggest that he has sold a substantial amount of his ETH holdings. He said he has not sold ETH for the past six years unless it was channelled into a project within the ecosystem or charity	ethereum
I haven’t sold and kept the proceeds since 2018. All sales have been to support various projects that I think are valuable, either within the Ethereum ecosystem or broader charity (eg	ethereum
biomedical research and development). Prior to his liquidation response, multiple sources disclosed that the Ethereum co-founder had transferred $10 million worth of ETH to an exchange	ethereum
According to Arkham Intelligence, 422,000 ETH ($1.04 billion) had been moved from a wallet address linked to Buterin between 2015 and September 1, 2024. 840,000 ETH has been moved out of the address in the past two years	wallet
On August 30, An X user also posted that Buterin dumped $2 million worth of ETH after making a bullish tweet. Confirming this, Lookonchain disclosed that 3000 ETH was sent to the same address on August 9

Buterin’s Remark on DeFi Recently, Buterin pointed out that $8.4 million in grants were awarded to ecosystem projects last quarter. On top of that, he named betting platform Polymarket and stablecoins USDC and RAI as part of the projects he believes in	defi
On the other side, Buterin expressed his displeasure with business models that incorporate liquidity farming. According to him, they mostly appear unsustainable with time	
Things that I don’t respect are things whose attractiveness comes from some temporary source that has no sustainability, eg. I felt no excitement toward the 2021-era liquidity farming craze because it was obvious that it came from token issuances that are fundamentally temporary	token
Reacting to his recent defence of Ethereum against the claim that the blockchain does not consider Decentralized Finance important, the inventor behind the concept of yield farming, Kain Warwick, mentioned that Buterin is not a Maxi. One of the most critical things that he’s gotten wrong over the last five years is the importance of DeFi	blockchain, ethereum, decentralized, defi
